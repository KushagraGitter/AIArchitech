# **App Name**: Architech AI

## Core Features:

- Visual Design Canvas: A drag-and-drop interface with prebuilt components for designing system architecture diagrams, including load balancers, API gateways, web servers, databases, caches, queues, and CDNs. Users can connect components and define relationships.
- AI-Powered Feedback: Generative AI powered system design feedback engine that uses the feature requirements and design, evaluates key design aspects (scalability, availability and cost). The system will reason using best practices in order to provide relevant feedback, making it an invaluable learning tool.
- Feature Requirements Input: Ability to write system requirements in a text area to feed the design analysis tool.
- Templates and Learning Modules: Ready-made templates for common and popular system designs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, attention-grabbing purple (#9D4EDD) to convey innovation and sophistication. 
- Background color: A very light gray (#F0F0F5) provides a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: A bright blue (#5603AD) is used for interactive elements and highlights, creating a clear visual hierarchy.
- Clean, sans-serif font optimized for readability on screen.
- Simple, minimalist icons to represent system components and actions.
- The layout focuses on a split-screen design, where the system design canvas occupies the majority of the space, while a sidebar on the left (or right) provides access to components, settings, and AI feedback.
